Counting sort assumes that for each input element X the number of input
elements is less than X.

For example, if 17 is less than X, then X belongs to the output position 18.
Algorihms requires an input array A[0..n], and thus A.length = n.
There are two additional arrays:
B[1..n] holds the sorted output.
C[0..k] provides temporary working storage.

Algorithm:
Counting-Sort(A,B,K)
let C[0..k] be a new array
for i = 0 to k
	C[i] = 0


// fill C with number equal to i
for j = 0 to A.length
	C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] + 1

// fill C with number less than or equal to i
for i = 1 to k
	C[i] = C[i] + C[i - 1]

for j = A.length down to 1
	B[C[A[j]]] = A[j]
	C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] - 1
